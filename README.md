Fabella is a web application that uses story-telling as a means of education.

In response to the 2016 American Election, we at Fabella decided to create
a platform in which members of various communities can share their stories and 
experiences living in America.  We intend this to be a platform to share stories 
which disprove stereotypes, document post-election bigotry, or simply
demonstrate kindness for all walks of life.  

We want our readers to walk away with a renewed sense of empathy for people with
different identities.  We believe storytelling is an effective means to accomplish this
goal.  Storytelling cannot be the sole education force, so we have included an 
interactive dataset focused on adressing this goal.

Our mission and goals are modeled after similar web initiatives, in particular,
the Facebook group "Pantsuit Nation" and Vox's "Secret Life of Muslims."

For developers:

React provided the structure to our website, and we have abstracted out different components for the 
various routes, as well as components for specific Stories, Reported Stories, etc.

Other libraries/frameworks we are using:
- lodash
- Firebase
- React-mdl
- Bootstrap
- React d3

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
